# Implementation Log - KISS Component-Based Approach

## Strategy: Component-Based Model
```
reimbursement = base_per_diem + mileage_component + receipt_component + bonuses/penalties
```

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Basic components (per diem + mileage + receipts)
2. **Phase 2**: Add 5-day bonus (most mentioned in interviews)
3. **Phase 3**: Add efficiency bonus (Kevin's insights)
4. **Phase 4**: Fine-tune based on data analysis
5. **Phase 5**: Machine Learning with Trip Categorization
6. **Phase 6**: Two-Model Architecture for Outliers

## Key Insights from Interviews
- Base per diem: ~$100/day
- Mileage: ~$0.58/mile with diminishing returns after 100 miles
- 5-day trips get consistent bonuses
- Efficiency sweet spot: 180-220 miles/day
- Receipt caps and penalties for very small/large amounts
- Kevin's "6 calculation paths" theory

## Guardrails
- ✅ Must output only a single number
- ✅ Must handle all input types gracefully
- ✅ Must run in under 5 seconds
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Test after each component addition

## Progress Log

### Phase 1: Basic Implementation ✅
- ✅ Copy template to run.sh
- ✅ Implement basic bash calculation
- ✅ Test with first few public cases
- ✅ Document initial accuracy

### Phase 2: Component Analysis ✅
- ✅ Analyze patterns in public_cases.json
- ✅ Identify outliers and special cases
- ✅ Implement 5-day bonus

### Phase 3: Advanced Components ✅
- ✅ Add efficiency bonuses
- ✅ Handle receipt penalties/caps
- ✅ Fine-tune parameters

### Phase 4: Validation ✅
- ✅ Run full evaluation
- ✅ Document final accuracy
- ✅ Optimize for edge cases

### Phase 5: Machine Learning Breakthrough ✅
- ✅ Switched from bash to Python for complex logic
- ✅ Implemented DecisionTreeRegressor with sophisticated feature engineering
- ✅ Added trip categorization (Kevin's "6 paths" theory)
- ✅ Created one-hot encoded trip categories: quick_trip_high_miles, long_haul, low_efficiency, sweet_spot_efficiency, balanced
- ✅ Tuned hyperparameters (max_depth=12, min_samples_leaf=3)

### Phase 6: Two-Model Architecture ✅
- ✅ Implemented separate models for normal vs high-receipt cases (>$1400 threshold)
- ✅ Specialized outlier model for complex high-receipt trip logic

## Current Status
✅ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED**

### Machine Learning Results (Phase 5)
- **Score**: 25,601 → **4,866** (81% improvement!)
- **Average Error**: $255 → **$47.66** (81% improvement!)
- **Close Matches**: 2 → **20** (10x improvement!)
- **Exact Matches**: Still 0, but significant progress toward goal

### Key Success Factors
1. **Trip Categorization**: Kevin's "6 paths" theory proved correct - different trip types need different logic
2. **Feature Engineering**: Advanced features capturing business rules from interviews
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Deeper decision tree captured more complex rules
4. **Python Implementation**: Enabled sophisticated ML algorithms vs limited bash math

### Technical Implementation
- **Model**: DecisionTreeRegressor with advanced feature engineering
- **Key Features**: 
  - Trip categories (quick_trip_high_miles, long_haul, etc.)
  - 3-tier mileage system
  - Receipt multipliers by trip length
  - Efficiency bonuses and penalties
  - Interaction features (days × miles)
- **Architecture**: Two-model system for normal vs outlier cases

### Next Optimization Targets
- **Goal**: Achieve first exact matches, score <1,000
- **Strategy**: Further refine outlier model and receipt logic
- **Potential**: Add more granular trip categories or ensemble methods

### Status: Ready for Final Optimization
The machine learning approach has proven highly effective, achieving our best score yet. The two-model architecture provides a clear path to handle the remaining high-error cases and push toward our goal of score <1,000.
